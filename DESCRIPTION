Description: There is a long tradition of studying the flux of carbon from the biosphere to the atmosphere by following a particular cohort of litter (wood, leaves, roots, or other organic material) through time.  The resulting data are mass remaining and time. A variety of functional forms may be used to fit the resulting data. Some work better empirically. Some are better connected to a process-based understanding.  Some have a small number of free parameters; others have more. This package matches decomposition data to a family of these curves using likelihood--based fitting. This package is based on published research by Cornwell & Weedon (2013) <doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12138>.
